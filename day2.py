# Python Data Types 

'''
On this second day of my code Challenge, I am looking at python Variables and data types.
** Data type refers to the different categorization of data in a way that python can understand and use them.
Below are some examples of data types in python with examples.
'''

# String: This data type is used when we want to write a sentence or alphabets on python. We enclose strings
# in quotation marks. However, python regards any data in quotation marks as a string. Consider the examples below.

str1 = 'This is a string.'
str2 = "This is a string with double quotes"

# Integer: This is a python data type that is used when we want to write numerical data on python. It must be numbers and doesnot need any
# special way to write it. Though individual digits or groups of digits are separated using commas. See the example below:

num1 = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
num2 = 123, 345, 564, 

# Float: This data type describes python numerical data that has decimals or fraction. It is written the same way integers are written
# however, it is written with a decimal point. Consider the example below:

float1 = 1.1, 2.3, 44.5

# Boolean: There are only two types of boolean data in python (True or False). Boolean data types are used in python for 
# decision making and they are built in data types. See example below:

bool1 = True
bool2 = False

# Dictionary: these are data types with key:value pairs. They are enclosed in curly brackets and each pair is separated with commas.
# Items on a dictionary are mutable. Consider the example below:

dict1 = {'Name': 'Uchechukwu Ohajuru', 'Phone Number': 98676355746}

# List: these data types are used to hold ordered collection of items that can be changed anytime within the program. This means that lsts 
# are mutable and can take more than one data type in a list. Lists are enclosed in a square bracket. Consider the example below:

list1 = [1, "a", 3]

# Tuple: This is an ordered and immutable collection of items. They are enclosed in parenthesis.
# It can also contain items of other data types. See example.

tup1 = (5, 'uche', [15, 16, 'Uncle'])

# Complex numbers: This is the data type that is used to represent data that has both real and imaginary parts.
# It is a numerical data type Example

comp1 = 4 + 3j

# Set: This is an unordered collection of unique items. It cannot take multiple entries of the same data,  
# however, items can be added to the list. Data here is enclosed in curly brackets
# for non empty set and parenthesis for empty sets.  Example:

set1 = (2, 4, 5)

Thank you for being part of today's post. 
See you tomorrow where we will look at variables in python.
