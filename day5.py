# Expresions in python

'''
This is where the challenge gets more interesting because expressions form the foundation of all python codes.

In python, expresions are combinations of values, variables, operators and functions in a way that python interprets 
it to produce a single result. Example:
'''

print('==================\n')
x = 6 # this assigns the value 6 to a variable x
y = 15 # this assigns the value 15 to the variable y

z =x+y # this is now is an expression in python. And when I execute it, a result (21) which can be seen using
#the print() function is displayed.
print(z)

print('==================\n')

# Let's have some more examples

age = 15
print(age>18) #Remembr > is a comparison operator and evaluates to True or False. The result if False because age is not greater than 18

print('====================\n')
