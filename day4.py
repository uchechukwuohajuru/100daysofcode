# Python Operators and Expressions

'''
We are on day 4 already! Today, we talk about Operators and expressions in python.
Operators are generally our way of helping python make decisions and take actions. And we have a number of them that we are going to
talk about.
'''
# Operators are symbols or keywords that we use to perform operation on one or more values or variables. 
# The variables in an operation are known as operands.

'''
We will categories them into:
1. Arithematic operators
2. Logical Operators
3. Comparison Operators
4. Assignment Operators
5. Identity Operators
6. Membership Operators
'''

# Arithematic Operators 
'''
(+) Addition Operator: This is used when we want ot sum two or more variables.
(-) Subtraction Operator: This is used when we want to subtract one variable from another.
(*) Multiplication Operator: This is used to get the product of two or more variables.
(**) Exponential Operator: This is used when we want to get the exponent of two or more variables.
(/) Division Operator: This is used to get the dividend of two or more variables.
(//) Floor division Operator: This is used when we want to get only the whole number part of a dividend
(%) Modulo Division Operator: This is used when we want to get only the fraction (decimal) part of a dividend.
'''

# Assignment Operators
'''
These are operators we use in assigning values to variables. Example:
(=) Assignment Operator: This is used to assign values to variables
(+=) Increment Assignment Operator: This increases a value and assigns it to the variable
(-=) Decrement Assignment Operator: This decreases a value and then assigns it to the variable
*** Any arithematic operator can be combined with an assignment operator to satisfy a uniqe use case.
'''
# Comparison Operators
'''
These are also called relational operators because they are used to compare one variable or value with another.
They return Boolean results. Example:
(==) Equal To Operator: This checks if two values or variables are equal
(!=) Not Equal To Operator: This checks if two variables are not equal
(>) Greater Than Operator: This checks if the variable on the right is bigger than the variable on the left
(<) Less Than Operator: This checks if the variable on the right is less than the variable on the left
(>=) Greater Than or Equal To Operator: This checks if the variable on the right is greater  than or equal to the variable on the left
(<=) Less Than or Equal To Operator: This checks if the variable on the right is less than or equal to the variable on the right
'''
# Logical Operators
'''
These are also called Boolean operators because they are used to combine conditional statements and evaluate Boolean expressions.
(and) Logical AND: This returns a True result if the two combined conditional statements are True or False. It returns False if 
any of them is False.
(or) Logical OR: This returns a True result if any one of the combined conditional statements is True
(not) Logical NOT: This returns a True result when non of the combined conditional statements is True
'''

# Identity Operators
'''
These are operators used to check if two variables refere to the same object in memory. They return Boolean results.
(is): shows that the object is the same
(is not): shows that the object is not the same
'''

# Membership Operators
'''
These are used to test for membership in a sequence.
(in): shows that the item is a member of the sequence
(not in): shows that the item is not a member of the squence
